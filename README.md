# The RoboticsCourse slice of the MLR code base

This code is a slice of the full MLR code base, containing
code for the robotics course exercises. This is the reason
for the unusual directory layout.


## Installation

Generically, the following should work:

cd share
make
make runTests
cd teaching/...

On problems, maybe you have to install some more Ubuntu
packages or adapt to other OS. Please refer to the files

* README.mlr.md
* install/INSTALL_ALL_UBUNTU_PACKAGES.sh

These two files refer to the whole MLR code base. You
probably need to install only a fraction of these packages.
