If you have any questions regarding this agreement or the licensing of this
technology, please send them to geom@cs.unc.edu.

Note that if you link Qhull to your application because of SWIFT++, you are
bound by their license agreements as well as this one.  A modified version of
the RAPID system is included with the included decomposer program.
Its license agreement (very similar to this one) also applies where applicable.
