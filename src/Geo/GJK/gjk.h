/** The main GJK distance routine.  This routine implements the routine
 * of Gilbert, Johnson and Keerthi, as described in the paper (GJK88)
 * listed below.  It also optionally runs my speed-up extension to this
 * algorithm, as described in (Cam97).
 
 *
 * The first 4 parameters are two pairs of parameters, one pair for
 * each hull; each pair is an object data-structure, plus a
 * transformation data-structure.  These data-structures are defined
 * to this code in gjk.h, and are designed to be opaque to this code;
 * the data is accessed through selectors, iterators and predicates,
 * which are discussed below.
 *
 * The 5th and 6th parameters are point arrays, that are set to the
 * coordinates of two witness points (one within each convex hull)
 * that realise the minimum distance between them.
 *
 * The actual return value for the function is the square of the
 * minimum distance between the hulls, which is equal to the (square
 * of the) distance between the witness points.
 *
 * The 7th parameter is a pointer to a simplex_point structure.  If
 * this is non-NULL then a special form of the witness points is
 * stored in the structure by the routine, suitable for passing to
 * this routine as seed points for any further calls involving these
 * two objects. The 8th parameter is a flag, which when set tells the
 * routine to use the given simplex_point structure instance as as
 * seed, otherwise it just uses any seed.  (If the 7th parameter is
 * NULL then no harm is done.)
 *
 * Note that with this version one field of the simplex_point structure
 * can be used to pass back the confidence region for the routine: when
 * the routine returns with distance squared equal to D*d, it means that
 * the true distance is known to lie between D-(E/D) and D, where E is
 * the positive value returned in the `error' field of the simplex_point.
 * Equivalently; the true value of the distance squared is less than or equal
 * to the value returned DSQ, with an error bound width of 2E - E*E/DSQ.
 * (In `normal' cases E is very small, and so the error bound width 2E can
 * be sensibly used.)
 *
 * The code will attempt to return with E<=EPSILON, which the user
 * can set, but will in any event return with some value of E.  In particular,
 * the code should return even with EPSILON set to zero.
 *
 * Alternatively, either or both of the pointer values for the witness
 * points can be zero, in which case those witness points are not
 * returned.  The caller can later extract the coordinates of the
 * witness points from the simplex_point structure by using the
 * function gjk_extract_point.
 *
 * Returning to the opaque data-structures used to describe the objects
 * and their transformations.  For an object then the minimum information
 * required is a list of vertices.  The vertices themselves are another
 * opaque type, accessed through the type VertexID.  The following macros
 * are defined for the vertices:
 *
 *  InvalidVertexID	 a VertexID which cannot point to a valid vertex
 *  FirstVertex( obj)	 an arbitrary first vertex for the object
 *  NumVertices( obj)	 the number of vertices in the object
 *  IncrementVertex(o,v) set vertex to the next vertex
 *  ValidVertex( obj, v) says whether the VertexID is valid for obj
 *  LastVertex( obj, v)  is this the last vertex?
 *  SupportValue(o,v,d)  returns support value for v in direction d
 *
 * Optionally, the object data-structures encode the wireframe of the objects;
 * this is used in my extended GJK algorithm to greatly speed up the routine
 * in many cases.  For an object the predicate ValidRing( obj) says whether
 * this information is provided, in which case the edges that surround any
 * can be accessed and traversed with the following:
 *
 *  FirstEdge( obj, vertex)	Returns the first edge (type EdgeID)
 *  IncrementEdge( obj, edge)	Sets edge to the next edge
 *  ValidEdge( obj, edge)      	Indicates whether edge is a real edge
 *  VertexOfEdge( obj, edge)	Returns the (other) vertex of an edge
 *
 * With this information this routine runs in expected constant time
 * for tracking operations and small relative motions.  If the
 * information is not supplied the the routine reverts to using the
 * original GJK technique, which takes time roughly linear in the number
 * of vertices.  (As a rough rule of thumb, this difference becomes
 * measurable at around 10 vertices per hull, and important at about
 * 20 vertices per hull.)
 *
 * Transformations are stored in data-structures given by opaque type
 * Transform, for which the following operations need to be defined:
 *
 *  IdentityTransform( t)	Might t be an identity transformation?
 *  ExtractTranslation( t, v)	Set v to the translation component of t
 *  ApplyTransform( t,o,v,tgt)  Apply transform to vertex v of o, result in tgt
 *  ApplyInverseRotation(t,d,r) Apply inverse of t to direction d, result in r
 *
 * Notes:
 *  + it is OK for IdentityTransform( t) to return false when t is
 *    in fact the identity (with a small time penalty)
 *  + ExtractTranslation equivalently sets v to where the origin is
 *    transformed to by t
